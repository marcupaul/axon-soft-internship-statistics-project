# AXON Soft Interview Project - Java Data Manipulator
Evaluation/interview project for the AXON Soft Java backend developer Summer 2023 position.

This project reads data from a locally-stored database in `.csv` format, validates the database's input against datetime constraints and regex formatting, then manipulates the data algorithmically and outputs it in `.json` format.

Due to constraints imposed by the interview evaluation statement, it primarily leverages the Java core libraries, as well as the Collections framework.
